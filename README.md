## Course Affiliation

This project was written for CSCI306: Software Engineering at Colorado School of Mines.
This was a *near* semester-long project with the goal of teaching pair programming and AGILE development in the context of a large-scale project.

As such, this project and its respective test cases was built in colloboration with my teammate Kevin O'Linn.

This code is free for you to explore and use, but I request that it only be used for non-profit/educational purposes.
Furthermore,  if by chance you find yourself working on the same project, I **strongly** recommend that you avoid reuse of any of this code.
