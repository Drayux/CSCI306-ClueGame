For our tests we wanted to make sure that the data is being loaded correctly.
In the TestRooms, we loaded a couple rooms from our CSV file including 
C for Asylum, B for BUtchers room, D for the dining room, and K for the Kitchen.

Next we wanted to check the 4 door directions and make sure our rooms meet the
proper tests including UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.
For the Asylum we checked a LEFT doorway.
For the Studio we checked for an UP doorway.
For the Dining room we checked for both UP and DOWN doorway because the room has both
and we wanted to ensure that the test would check both types of doorway entry.
With The kitchen we tested another RIGHT doorway to ensure the right wors.


For the testRoomIntitals to test the first cell we picked the lowest row/col
to find the first cell in each room. To find the last cell we picked the 
highest row/col combination for each room.
