The most significant change we made from our code review was the "Clean up" of our calcTargets function.
Before the code review this function was bit messy, after the code review we realized that some of our code
could be condensed to a cleaner less bulky function. We made the changes and successfully changed our 
CalcTargets function to run smoother without all of the "bulk".
